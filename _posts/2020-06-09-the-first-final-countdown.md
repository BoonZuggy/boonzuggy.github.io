[Code complete y'all](https://media.giphy.com/media/3rgXBQIDHkFNniTNRu/giphy.gif)! We got all of our features completed more or less on time, which is pretty rad. But just 'cuz things are "done" doesn't mean that they're *done*...we've got one last coat of paint to throw onto our hulking mutant baby.

## Recap

- Got all them freakin' **features completed**, as mentioned. This was a big team effort!

- Che has started **animating** a giant, terrifying sky-creature.

- Jakob knocked out the **instructional email** for our testers.

- We had a dope **internal feedback meeting** on the build. Opinions were proffered, ideas were germinated, Kojima was questioned, and spam ([the food, not the email](https://riversworld389522389.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/b9hg76y.jpg?w=474)) was defended.

## Coming Up

Coming out of our feedback meeting, the week ahead has some clear-cut goals:

- We're going to focus on some **movement tweaks**, **fixing bullets / firing**, and **making enemies less wacky**. If we can nail these, I'll feel good about showing this thing to testers.

- We're also going to make sure that the **camera** is good, the **level** is populated, and **components have the right values**.

- We'll also finalize the **tester questionnaire** this week.

The goal is to have this thing in the hands of our testers on **6/15**. I think we can do it!!

## Miscellany

- I've been reading [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom-ebook-dp-B00P5URD96/dp/B00P5URD96/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1591637561) and it's really fantastic. Light, readable, and thorough. None of it feels *super* applicable to what we're doing right now, but I'm really appreciating the knowledge (and experiencing the author's thought process).

- I started listening to the [Coffee with Butterscotch](https://www.bscotch.net/podcast/261) podcast. The hosts are really funny, and the insights they have about game development are really interesting.

## And last...
