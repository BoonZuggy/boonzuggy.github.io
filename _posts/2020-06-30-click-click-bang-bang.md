We were all about weapons this week! I personally had a blast ([PUN INTENDED](https://media0.giphy.com/media/1gArwncRlXac8GIhNy8/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476ca20565f2c923a05d73b2d4b23387677280d68c&rid=giphy.gif)), and it felt extremely fruitful. As we sprint towards nailing down the scope of our next playtest, weapons have been one of the big unknown areas (especially given the feedback we've gotten from the *first* playtest). I feel like we got a lot of clarity quickly, and we're in a much better position to make some choices and move forward.

## Recap

- Jakob made a really tasty **playtest insights presentation**, which had great summaries of the trends we've seen from our testers.

- We **juiced the fuck** out of initial weapon implementation. Holy cow! What a difference! It's kind of shocking how much better everything feels when there are explosions and screen shakes. I personally was humbled and surprised at how much of a difference this stuff makes! I was also stoked that we were able to make a ton of progress on this with relatively little effort.

- We implemented a whole bunch of **new weapons**! Laser, mortars, sonic blasts, flame waves - all very cool to see (and play with)!

- Anthony pumped out a bunch of new **weapon sounds**. Pew pew! Zappity zap!

- Jakob has put together an initial draft of a **new GDD**. The shape of playtest 2 is beginning to hazily take shape on the horizon!

## Coming Up

- We're gonna wrap up our **weapon explorations** with a few final tweaks.

- **Agilities**! We're all about agilities this week. We've got some good initial ideas in the GDD already, but they need to be explored further (and implemented!). I'm really excited to see how these play out. In my mind, they have the potential to be super cool, and could give the game a unique and super-fun hook.

- Continue doing explorations of our other **outstanding questions** (level structure and enemies). Should we allocate time explicitly for these things? Expect a lengthy debate about this topic in #general...

## And last...
