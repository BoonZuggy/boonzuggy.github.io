Another good week in BZ land! Our momentum feels good, and we're getting ready to buckle down and make some real magic. Some highlights of the past week:

## Recap

- **Marc joined the team!** Give it up for the dude. Despite being located in a far off land (Australia, to be exact), he's already hit the ground running. Yay Marc!

- Me and Jakob nailed down the **play test scope**. It's gonna be pretty dang simple!

- We settled on a **task management system** (it's Asana)!

- Jakob did some great work both making a **proxy level**, and then making a smaller level for the play test. He also surveyed the group about control schemes.

- Che has made some **super sick models** - BZ, an enemy, and some environmental bits. He's also done some really cool work with Blender's toon shader.

- Anthony has made some bonkers **sound effects**. At one point, he was throwing a candlestick at a metal plate or something. Sheer anarchy.

- Marc has started hacking on the **camera system**, and is chewing through programming tasks in anticipation of the play test.

## Coming Up

It's all about that first play test!

- We're going to have a kick-off for this phase tonight, and we've got some important things to nail down (making sure our production pipeline is well-articulated, discussing timeline, etc.). I'll have an agenda out later today.

- All of our personal tasks should already be in Asana. We're in good shape here - tons of stuff has already gotten done (art and sound are...almost done?). There's some more programming stuff to do (and a few logistical bits to sort out), but I ain't stressed.

## Miscellany

- Following up on my marketing thoughts from last week, I'm going to be chatting with a marketing-savvy friend this week to just pick his brain. I've been collecting a range of ideas around this (how to tell our team's story in a compelling way, potential channels beyond just Twitch, etc.), so I'm excited to have someone to bounce things off of. I'll report back with anything interesting that comes from that.

- I've also been thinking more about the holistic plan / timeline for the project. I've been mulling on an idea which might be either very standard, or very stupid (I can't tell). Uninformed rambling follows:

  My understanding is that the typical model of game development has a delimited period of pre-production (during which big questions are answered, and things are de-risked as best they can be), then there's an extended period of production (when stuff gets built and content gets created), then a final phase of testing and polishing.

  However, I've been thinking of a slightly different, slightly more iterative model. As opposed to doing *all* of the pre-production up front, then putting our heads down and just buildin' shit, I propose a model that I'm calling **3X**, which stands for **explore**, **execute**, and **experience**. **Exploring** means exploring some new set of ideas; **executing** is implementing the stuff, and **experiencing** means getting someone to experience what we've built (which is to say, play testing). The idea here is to have mini versions of pre-production, production, and polishing, with the goal of having something testable and playable at the end of each cycle. This cribs a lot from the Agile methodology, but I don't know if I've ever heard this recommended in exactly this form.

  The scope of the actual things we're working on in each cycle might change, as might the duration of each cycle. For example, we might have a cycle devoted *just* to weapons, wherein we **explore** a bunch of weapon ideas, **execute** the ones we feel strongest about, and then get testers to **experience** them in the game. This cycle might take just two weeks total, while a cycle about something more substantial (like an upgrade system) might take more like four weeks.

  I'm bringing this up a) to see if this makes any sense, or is distinct enough from standard operating procedure to even be named explicitly, and if so b) to see if people like this way of working, and if so c) to load this terminology and philosophy into peoples' brains and get buy-in. If we start working this way, it'll also influence how we think about the timeline of the whole project - I'll be thinking of "domains" that need complete cycles devoted to them. The aforementioned weapons will probably be one, as will level generation, scoring, and other level-agnostic gameplay "systems." However, I can also see us doing a cycle on each particular level, say, or on experimental ideas like local multiplayer.

  The act of doing a cycle has overhead, so we can't cycle *all* the things. We'll have to do our best to group things up such that we have a chance to address every essential gameplay element, while also decomposing things enough that we can give really important elements as much prominence in a cycle as possible. We can also assign approximate sizes to different potential cycles, and use this to get some confidence around a possible launch date. Lastly, having things decomposed into discrete cycles might make them easier to sequence - essential domains will have to come first (as will ones towards the inner valences of the Nested Circle Diagram Thing), and less essential domains can be sequenced later, so they can be elided if need be.

  Is this pure malarky? Have an opinion? Let's discuss in #devlog.

## And last...
