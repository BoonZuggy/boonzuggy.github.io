We're soldiering along! We're remaining in our relatively steady groove, continuing to make progress. Slow and steady wins the race!

## Recap

- Che did a bunch of **learning about Unity**. Volumetric lighting, shaders, and environment bits are all starting to [take shape](/assets/lighting.png)! We also got some rudimentary **building block assets**, so we can start assembling those if we so choose.

- Jakob wrote up some concepts for potential **challenges**, and went the extra mile by making some SketchUp sketches as well.

- The **grey box level** is populated, and we can now drive around in it to get a sense of scale and space.

- Anthony made some completely awesome **music** (and threw in some boost sound effects for good measure!)

- I did a fair amount of work tightening up the **movement mechanics**. Some things made an impact, some didn't. It feels good enough for now, and we have more pressing concerns (specifically, the **charge dash**!)

- I also wrote a little screenplay for an **intro**. I doubt we'll make such a thing, but maybe it will come in handy for helping us build a shared understanding of the world.

## Coming Up

- Che is continuing to work on tightening up the aesthetic aspects of the **environment**. Our goal is to be able to drive through a test landscape with volumetric lighting, trees, grass, and particle effects.

- Jakob is going to work on coming with some "**two-challenge permutations**" of the game; I think applying these constraints early will help us keep scope in check, and will most likely spur additional creativity (as constraints as wont to do!)

- I'm going hard on **charge locking**, since that's a prerequisite to us building out combat in any meaningful way.

## Miscellany

- I ended up buying [Values at Play in Digital Games](https://www.amazon.com/Values-at-Play-Digital-Games-ebook/dp/B08BSZF85G/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=values+at+play&qid=1595614905&s=digital-text&sr=1-3), and am working my way through it. It's pretty academic, but is also getting me to expand my thinking on what games can do, and what I personally want to do with them.

- The [Amy Hennig episode](https://interactive.libsyn.com/027-amy-hennig-tgmn-v2) of the Game Maker's Notebook podcast is fucking *awesome*. She has tons of hard-won wisdom to share, but the real payoff is her vision for the future of narrative gaming, especially as it pertains to people who don't consider themselves "gamers." I wonder what interesting stuff she's going to launch while at [Skydance](https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/18/skydance-media-taps-amy-hennig-to-launch-new-game-studio-for-story-based-games/)...

- I've started listening to the [Triple Click](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/) podcast, and it's light and fun! I like the hosts a lot, and they're pretty insightful. I wouldn't consider it essential listening, but a nice change of pace.

## And last...
