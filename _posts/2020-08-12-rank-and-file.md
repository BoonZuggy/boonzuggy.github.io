What's that there, looming on the horizon? Why - it's another playtest! Per the great suggestion by Jakob, we're starting to set our sights on trying to get everything into a playable state, and sending something out to our lovely testers yet again. I think this is really exciting - we've had a goodly amount of time to explore without a ton of pressure, but having a milestone to hit infuses everything with consequence and forward momentum. Shipping makes it real!

## Recap

- Everyone made some **level sketches**! They're all in different states of playability, but we're all getting a handle on tooling and workflow, so that's to be expected. The levels we *were* able to play gave us a ton of insight into what we need to improve.

- The new enemy known as **"Spike Face"** was born into this world! We think he'll be a good foil for the combat systems we're working on. He'll be implemented this week.

- I did a bunch of work on **dash chaining**. It's really tough! We had some good back and forth about how it's supposed to work, and I made a few abortive attempts to explore some slightly different directions. I'll be looping back to this once we've got some enemies, and some other systems are tightened up a bit.

## Coming Up

- We want nail down a date for our **next playtest**! We'll most likely arrive at this date using a combination of intuition and rational analysis. I'm genuinely very excited to get this locked in - I love moving towards a well-defined milestone!

- We're overflowing with **coding tasks**! I'll start with getting Spike Face ready for prime time, then move on to either camera controls, better jumping and landing, dash chaining, or Explode-O: The Exploding Enemy.

- Jakob is going to get the **level sketches** fully playable in Unity. The GDD will also be updated with our newest orthodoxy on enemies and dash chaining.

- Che is going unifying the **level aesthetics**; this will involve re-implementing one of the levels as floating islands (instead of sinister synthwave towers), experimenting with a toon shader, and gathering consensus from the group around global lighting and shader choices.

- Anthony is going to be noodling on **sounds for Spike Face**, as well as doing some thinking on what we hope to accomplish with the playtest.

## Miscellany

- I'm taking an informal break from learning about games! I was ingesting information at a pretty breakneck pace, and it was kind of all-consuming. I'm sure I'll return to it soon enough, but I naturally go through ebbs and flows with these kinds of things. I've learned in my ripe old age to not fight it; I just go along with what's happening naturally.

  That having been said, I'm now gobbling up fiction books! I've started in on [The Starless Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Starless-Sea-Novel-Erin-Morgenstern-ebook/dp/B07MQPHKSL/ref=sr_1_2?crid=24VNPCFCWVDQL&dchild=1&keywords=the+starless+sea&qid=1597255462&sprefix=the+stareless%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-2), which I'm really enjoying. It's a literary fantasy book with a dash of loopy meta-textual stuff (how pretentious would I be if I used the word Borgesian?). The Amazon reviews aren't terribly glowing, but I'm finding it captivating and extremely well-written. We'll see!

- I rarely talk about what I'm *playing*, but maybe I'll start! My two repeats this week have been Smash Ultimate and Mario Maker 2. I've been playing through Wells' Super World, and it's been...super fun! His level designs are really clever (and also hard as fuck!) My Smash ranking has been rising at a satisfying rate. Playing a match or two in the evening is a perfect bite-sized competitive experience.

  I also picked up [The Flame in the Flood](http://www.themolassesflood.com/the-flame-in-the-flood) on sale, but haven't gotten into it yet. The atmosphere looks exceptional, and I'm always hungry for more roguelites. I've also never really played a survival game, so I'm interested to see what that's about. Maybe this weekend...

## And Last...
