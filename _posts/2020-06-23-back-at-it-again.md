This past week was slow - intentionally so! I tend to find that after I go hard to meet some kind of deadline, I usually get a little bit of a "hangover" as my energy level comes back down. This week was our opportunity to sleep off the hangover, as it were.

## Recap

- Got some **playtests** back! Fantastic insights coming out of these; some things worked, some things didn't, and I personally am seeing a ton of actionable steps coming out of these.

- Renewed discussion about the prospect of adding some form of **multiplayer**. This is a complex topic! We'll be talking about it more.

- Some interesting **noodles and doodles**. Che made a super cool racetrack, which inspired me to think about level structure and write up some ideas. We're keeping things on a low simmer!

## Coming Up

- Next cycle **kick off meeting** tonight! We'll be digging into really important topics, including our holistic schedule, the aforementioned multiplayer issue, takeaways from playtesting, and the most important questions we need answers to to go forward.

- Based on the outcome of that meeting, we'll hopefully be using this week to try to either **fix issues** surfaced during the playtest, or **explore question areas** that we need clarity on. TBD!

- I've pushed off our **"big picture" meeting**, but I'll be scheduling that for either this weekend or the next.

## Miscellany

- On a whim, I emailed the author of the book I mentioned in [this post](/hello-world). To my great surprise, he emailed me back and was very gracious! The internet may be terrible in many ways, but the fact that it enables randos like me to get in touch with luminaries from various fields is a really incredible thing. Maybe human beings are OK after all!

## And last...
