We're continuing to make steady and satisfying progress. It might not be the same wild flurry of activity that we experienced in earlier phases, but it feels fun, collaborative, and exciting. There's something to be said for settling into a process that's enjoyable in the moment! I also feel like we're continuing to refine and lock in on a really tractable and cool concept.

## Recap

- Che and Jakob both did some work on sketching out **challenge levels**; Jakob picked SketchUp as his weapon of choice and made some really cool mockups, while Che brought things into Blender and gave 'em a high-tech sheen.
- Jakob also put together a gaggle of **"two-challenge" permutations**, which was a good exercise. It helped us to narrow things down a bit, and now I think we're pretty aligned on what we're going to focus on.
- Che threw together a lovely autumnal **environment** and dug into some new shmancy **art tools**.
- We made some really dope progress on the **dash lock**. It was collaborative victory - we had a good feedback loop going, coding stuff up and getting feedback. And now it's quite tight!

## Coming Up

- This week is all about **level sketches**! Jakob, Che, and Anthony are all gonna be coming at this from different angles. I'm stoked to see what we come up with!
- I'm going to start digging into **dash chaining**. I think it's gonna be kind of a hairy beast, but if we get it right, I think it'll become the crux of the game. Fingers crossed!
- We're going to get started on an **enemy**; Jakob will start with some specifications, and if I have time, I'll hack something together.

## Miscellany

- I've gotten back into the [Designer Notes podcast](https://www.idlethumbs.net/designernotes/episodes). I've started with the [Adam Saltsman ones](https://www.idlethumbs.net/designernotes/episodes/adam-saltsman-part-1), and I like 'em. They're less produced and kind of relaxed, but still informative and entertaining.
- Jakob found this fuckin' [level design megamix](https://trello.com/b/yR8J4UQ6/curated-level-design-compendium). Looks very useful!
