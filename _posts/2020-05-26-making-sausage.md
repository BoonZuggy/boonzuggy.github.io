At long last - we're actually building a dang game! It's been super cool to start integrating real assets, building out features, and making real software.

## Recap

- Jakob has been crushing the **initial testing logistics**. We've gotten dozens of testers signed up via our screener form (and if some you're some rando from the internet who happens to be reading this, [you too](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed_Kld6eLxb_6Qokcgpl2Ap6vwUnd57ljoVj9UDU3JjKjgpw/viewform) can participate!).

- Che is continuing to explore **enemies and environments**. Y'all ain't even *ready* for Filthy Pete...

- Marc and I are **coding up a storm**. We're making great progress through our tasks (including shooting, game state management, controller support, enemy spawning, and more). I'm feeling good about our velocity, and I think we're going to be finishing up right around when we estimated we would.

## Coming Up

- More execution! The last big remaining stream of work is related to BZ himself - getting the right model in there and fleshing out his move set.

- Polish! I'm going to make sure that WebGL builds happen on a regular basis (either manually or via Github Actions) so that we can be playing the canonical build often. Once we've got our hands on the real thing, I'm sure we'll start generating tons of polish tasks and bugs, which I'll help manage and triage.

## Miscellany

- I had a great chat with my friend about marketing. I learned a bunch about Twitch as a platform, and he had some really sharp ideas about our potential market. However, the one thing we spoke about that really stuck with me is the prospect of making the launch of a our game an "event" (as well as we can, with a marketing budget of zero dollars...).

  I mean, look - obviously no one is going to intrinsically care about the launch of BZ (except maybe our moms and dads?). But I like the idea of truly viewing our offering as a gift - something that has the potential to really bring fun and delight to people. Viewed in that light, why *wouldn't* we want people to know about our game? Granted, we have to actually build something awesome - that's a prerequisite. But I really like the perspective of making the game an offering, and making that initial offering a celebration.

- Building the playtesting group is so exciting. The prospect of creating a real community that we can work with over the course of development is so cool, and makes things very real for me. It also connects to the previous point - this group will serve as representatives for the people for whom we're making our game, and their insights and perspectives will deeply inform the choices we make.

## And last...
