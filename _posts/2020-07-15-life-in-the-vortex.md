Whoa...has it seriously only been 8 days since the last devlog entry? I think we entered some sort of weird Time Vortex. It felt like an incalculable amount of stuff happened in the last week, but simultaneously we're kind of in the same spot we were in before? But also we learned an important lesson maybe? Such is the creative process.

## Recap

- We changed the **scope** of the project! Now we're just shooting for a demo, which feels much more attainable.

- We **named the team**! Peep that URL bar! I personally am stoked on the name.

- We had brief and passionate creative digressions towards **marbles and planetoids**! Even though we eventually steered ourselves back towards the original concept, it was still a useful experience.

- There's a lot that was **unsummarizable** about the past week (see the intro - a Time Vortex was involved). In short, the way I see it, we experienced a transition as a team; we're now really starting to lock onto a concept and make it manageable enough to produce. The time of expansion is coming to a close, and the time of convergence and production approaches.

## Coming Up

- Jakob's got some **big design tasks!** Nailing down the mechanics of the two (!) core moves and detailing what some challenges might look like are big headlines this week. From there, I can start coding up the moves just so, and from the outline of the challenges we can start producing assets with which to build them. Foundational stuff!

- Che's going to be doing work around defining more of the **visual style**, which might include concept art, and messing around with lighting and terrain and such.

- We've got ourselves a **new repo**! I'll be getting it set up, moving over the assets we want to retain from the last playtest, and cleaning everything up so it's easy for us to tweak the parameters on our prefabs. My inner Marie Kondo is loving it!

- Anthony's gonna be noodling on some **sound effects**, especially ones that might help us emphasize the sense of space in the desert.

## Miscellany

- I'm continuing to chew through the [Boss Fight Books](https://bossfightbooks.com/). The one on [Shovel Knight](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/shovel-knight-by-david-l-craddock) is a fantastic showcase of the team's process and approach to game design. I'm now halfway through the one on [ZZT](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/zzt-by-anna-anthropy), which is like catnip to me ('cuz I'm obsessed with both game-making tools and online communities, and the story of ZZT is the story of both!)

- I'm also reading this [very cheesy book](https://www.amazon.com/Gamestorming-Playbook-Innovators-Rulebreakers-Changemakers/dp/0596804172/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2A0MBSG1V5EPU&dchild=1&keywords=gamestorming&qid=1594783827&sprefix=gamestorming%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1), which, despite being an embarrassingly wonky business-style book, is also filled with some fantastic nuggets of wisdom about both leading a creative team and game design itself (!). A really odd book, but I'm in its niche...

- The [GDC Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gdc-podcast/id1476405424) is actually pretty good! I've only listened to a handful so far, but their guests are really interesting, and the conversations have all been informative.

## And last...
