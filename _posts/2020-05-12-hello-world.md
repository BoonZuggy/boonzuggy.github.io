Welp - we're gonna give this devlog thing a shot. While this might at some point be read by the general public, I'm writing this primarily for us, as a way to recap the awesome stuff that's occurred, and think a bit about where want to get to in the coming week.

## Recap

Last week felt like a pretty good week. Some highlights that spring to mind:

- We settled on using **3D instead of 2D**! This was a much-belabored decision, but after some prototyping and art explorations, it's seeming like the right way to go. There are still some unknowns, and there's a bit of a learning curve, but the increased flexibility, easier asset creation, and general feel of 3D seem worth it.

- After getting some clarity on the four environments we want to create, we started **brainstorming enemies**. *TONS* of great ideas, both aesthetically and mechanically. We didn't really close this loop yet - I'm sure we'll return to this as we start nailing down exactly what's in our first playtest.

- Che posted tons of **cool art shit** - overall style guide, some concept art, initial modeling tests, ref boards and mockups for (almost) all of the environments, and some preliminary models of our boy BZ! (is BZ a boy? is gender even a thing in the game universe? unclear :shrug:)

- Anthony posted an **insanely funky piece of music** for the swamp environment, complete with thick bug noises, banjo pluckin', slide guitar, and a slippery bassline. It's catchy as hell!

## Coming Up

As a result of a handful of conversations that occurred last week, I'm getting the sense that we should begin narrowing our focus towards our first playtest. To that end, there are a handful of things that I think would be worth focussing on this week:

- **Finalize playtest scope**: what exactly is going to be in the playtest? Is there anything specific that we want to learn? Will we want BZ to have certain moves implemented? A weapon? Enemies to gank? If so - how many, and which kinds? A score? My guess is that **Jakob** is gonna largely own this.

- **Hack out a proxy level**: Also on **Jakob**'s plate is putting together a proxy level for our playtest. Scatter interesting little doodads around! An artisanal, hand-crafted environment!

- **Pick a task management system**: Something for **me** to drive is settling on some kind of slightly more formalized system for keeping track of what we need to do to get things into a testable state.

- **Make art, code, 'n sounds**: Once we know exactly what needs to get done for the first playtest and we've got a system for tracking that....it's time to make gravy! Many models to make, things to code, beeps to boop. Out of pre-production and into production!

## Miscellany

- I'm talking to a **potential new addition** to our team on Monday night (a coder!). I'll report back about this on Tuesday.

- **Marketing**: even though we're still at the beginning of our journey, marketing is something we need to start thinking about. This blog is going to be one such potential vehicle, but I'm also going to start investigating Twitch in a serious way. I'm especially interested in lower- to mid-tier streamers - not the folks with the absolute biggest followings, but those who have *some* followers, and tend to like games like ours. I'm also going to look into how other dev teams use Twitch to run their own streams. I would love to do this if it would be useful! I'll also be talking to a few friends about their thoughts.

- I've started reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Indie-Games-Delivery-Don-Daglow-ebook/dp/B079NSDVSF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1O9HOZ1HZFU4S&dchild=1&keywords=indie+games+from+dream+to+delivery&qid=1589221998&sprefix=indie+game%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-1), and it's quite excellent. Lots of advice on many aspects of the game development process.
