This week felt like it had a lot going on! Agilities were explored, planetoids were orbited, mortar pig rolled out of the gate (and into our hearts), and much more! We're definitely in an exploratory phase; it feels like we're churning up lots of ideas and possibilities. While it can occasionally border on overwhelming (for me, anyways), it also feels like the right space to inhabit for the time being, and from this chaos emerges our most interesting work!

## Recap

- Che got into tons of stuff this week; he figured out how to get **animations** imported (rocket boost!) and made some sick **generated landscapes** (which then evolved into **generated planetoids**, which then evolved into [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699254542050787380/729525839427010570/unknown.png)!).

- We also got our second real enemy in the mix - **Mortar Pig** (aka Slow Man)! He's got a little bit of behavior and a little bit of animation; I'm sure both will evolve as we play with the little guy.

- We did a whole bunch of prototyping on **agilities** (and tangentially, our **combat controls**). They're pretty rough, but hopefully they give us some insight into how these might eventually feel, and how we might incorporate them into core gameplay.

- Jakob has gotten a good start on a **second test level**. I'm sure we'll iterate heavily on this as get more into level structure, but it's great to start with a concrete rough draft at the outset.

## Coming Up

- We have a **meeting** tonight where we'll be talking about what we're gonna do next (amongst other topics), but based on what we've talked about earlier...

- **Enemies**! We've already dipped our toe in this stream, but let's make a whole bunch of different enemies to see how they feel. These are another crucial input to our level designs, so aggressively exploring this possibility space is pretty important.

- **Animations**! Let's get some animations wired up for real to make sure that that pipeline is working as expected.

- Continue to hack on **level structure**. Even though we'll have some dedicated time for this, the more thinking we can do on this ahead of the fact, the better.

## Miscellany

- I've discovered [Boss Fight Books](https://bossfightbooks.com/) and have become obsessed with them. I've already read the absolutely fantastic book on [Spelunky](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu) (written by Derek Yu himself!) and the appropriately post-modern book on [EarthBound](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/earthbound-by-ken-baumann). The Spelunky book in particular was a treasure trove of indie game development wisdom (in particular, it's pointed me at [this quote](https://quotes.yourdictionary.com/author/shigeru-miyamoto/85570), which has gained mantra-like significance for me...)

- I've also been listening to a lot of the very excellent [Game Maker's Notebook](https://www.interactive.org/Interviews/the_game_makers_notebook.asp) podcast. The episodes with [Lucas Pope](https://interactive.libsyn.com/lucas-popes-return-of-the-obra-dinn), [Jamie Cheng](https://interactive.libsyn.com/dont-starves-jamie-cheng-of-klei-entertainment), and [Arvi Teikari](https://interactive.libsyn.com/baba-is-you-creator-arvi-teikari) are all standouts.
