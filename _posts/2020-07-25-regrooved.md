Oh wow - did I forget to do a devlog update at the regularly scheduled time? All of the hard living I've been doing must be catching up with me! Just kidding - I haven't left the house in like six weeks. Quarantine life!

It feels like we're fully back in the groove now, after some minor disruptions. We're making great progress across all disciplines in a way that feels sustainable and enjoyable.

## Recap

- Jakob did some good thinking around our **movement mechanics**. We're starting to get really detailed on these, which is great! More wood behind fewer arrows, as they say.

- Che did some great explorations around **concept art** and general **aesthetic direction**. The game's really starting to have a [look](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/713561346121138227/733975005091856464/tallRender.png)!

- We've now got an initial **asset list**; mostly environmental bits that we'll be using to build out the level.

- Jakob also started to build out an initial **grey box level**. This has been super helpful for understanding the scale of the space, and for building a shared understanding of what the end product might feel like.

- We've moved everything over to the **new repo**. Hubba hubba! It's like living on a beautiful spaceship. [Everything in its right place](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/713561346121138227/733975005091856464/tallRender.png)!

- I did a lot of work tightening up the core **movement mechanics**. I also removed a bunch of unused prototype stuff in the process. There's more to do here for sure, but it felt like a good start.

## Coming Up

- Che's got more **technical explorations** to do. URP! Shaders! Lights! And so on. Also, he'll be building out **environmental assets** to be used in the grey box level.

- Jakob is going to write up descriptions of the initial five **challenges**, add more defined specifications for the **charge dash**, and continue to flesh out the **grey box level** (ideally using the assets that Che is making).

- I'm continuing to tighten up the **movement mechanics**, as well as implementing the new **charge dash** and **dash chaining** mechanics.

- Anthony might start noodling on **musical ideas**. I think digging into this will help us start to get a bead on the emotional flavor of the level.

## Miscellany

- This might be obvious to everyone, but I've recently felt a shift in our relationship to time and schedules. Whereas before I felt very cognizant of how much time we had "left" and how fast everything was going, ever since we changed the scope of the project (and after having our [Weird Week](/life-in-the-vortex)), I'm feeling like we're just taking each week as it comes. Despite being a generally schedule-oriented person, I'm really happy with this change. It feels like the right mode to be in right now.

  So long as we're making progress week over week and the stuff we're doing is high-value, I don't think it makes sense to stress about the holistic schedule. I anticipate that this will change in a few weeks (I think things will begin to feel progressively more production-y, and will thus become more regimented and predictable), but I'm really enjoying the vibe as it is today.

- Books! After reading the [Baldur's Gate II Boss Fight book](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/baldurs-gate-ii-by-matt-bell), I finally feel like I'm reaching a point of diminishing returns. Time to take a break from those. However! I'm currently reading samples of both [Architectural Approach to Level Design](https://www.amazon.com/Architectural-Approach-Level-Design-Second-ebook-dp-B07RBC2PD6/dp/B07RBC2PD6/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1595614876) and [Values at Play in Digital Games](https://www.amazon.com/Values-at-Play-Digital-Games-ebook/dp/B08BSZF85G/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=values+at+play&qid=1595614905&s=digital-text&sr=1-3), both of which I'm really enjoying, despite their more academic bent.

- I watched this absolutely *fantastic* video from Zak McClendon called [Welcome to the Yard Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZoGDKy_L4). It made a huge impact on me. It's seems like an incredible way to orient a group towards a collectively-assembled, shared vision for a game. I'd like to start incorporating some of these ideas into our process, though probably not until we start our next project.

- I've subscribed to a newsletter called [The Pause Button](https://pausebutton.substack.com/), and I'm really enjoying it! It's a good overview of industry news, skewing a bit more towards the AAA / big company side of things.

- I've started listening to the [Waypoint Radio](https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/waypoint-radio) podcast. It's pretty good! Most of the other game podcasts I've listened to are more industry-/creator-centric, and this one feels like it communicates more of a player's/critic's perspective.

- It's looking like we might be booting up some social accounts soon! Che did a first pass at a logo, and it's *insanely* cool looking. Once we've got all that sorted, we'll most likely start posting more visually-oriented things on those accounts (stuff like videos / screenshots / pictures of my kitten).

- I've started writing some essays! I have a number of ideas in the hopper, and I've started doing drafts of a few different things. This is not super relevant to the project, but if I finish them up and post them, hopefully they can serve as another way our group might get some attention and publicity (plus, I'll take any excuse to bloviate about my personal theories about games and whatnot).

## And last...
