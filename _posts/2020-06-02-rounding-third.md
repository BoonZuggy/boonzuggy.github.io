Building building building! It feels like we're now in the phase of development where we take two steps forward and one step back - stuff is getting done, but the goal posts keep slipping a bit further into the distance. We're getting the hang of working in the same codebase, integrating our work, and making sure everything is still feeling OK with each change. It's all part of the process!

## Recap

- Jakob finalized our initial **list of testers**!

- Anthony has been making extremely cool **animation demos**: explosions, fizzles, and glitched-out spawning.

- Che has done some really awesome explorations around **particle effects** and **textures**.

- Me and Marc have been coding up **features on features**! A few more remain, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

- All of us have been posting and reading **marketing videos and articles**. I've been picking up tons of ideas for what we can do to build awareness and excitement around our project.

- I posted some **half-baked worldbuilding thoughts**. Were they helpful? Were they cogent? Most likely not, but I had fun.

- We've got semi-regular **WebGL builds** coming out, which have been super helpful for identifying issues and verifying that all of our work is meshing together as expected.

## Coming Up

- I'd like to have all the remaining **playtest logistics** fully ironed out this week.

- Let's get through our **last slate of tasks**!

- We should meet next weekend for a **Playtest Polish Pow-Wow**! I think we can get our tasks done by then, so we should be able to play with a build and come prepared with polish suggestions and bug reports.
