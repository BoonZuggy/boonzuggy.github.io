Holy fucking fuckballs - we've got ourselves a game folks!! Incredible effort from each person on the team this past week to get everything knitted together and polished up. It feels like we really hit our stride, and the result is starting to get genuinely fun. And now it's time to put it in front of people and have them tell us why we suck...

## Recap

- Che was on it with hella new **models** (terrain features, challenge objects, goal flags, speed boosts, the turret, etc etc etc), and a smooth new **texture** for the terrain.

- Anthony cranked out a new **music loop** and tons of sparkly new **sound effects**. Love that 8-bit powerslide sound!

- Jakob actually made the **test level** into, like, a game. Also **tuned** the game object parameters like a fine Stradivarius.

- There was also lot of fucking **coding** going on - cranking out features, squashing bugs, and all that jazz.

## Coming up

- [**Celebrate!**](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l46CimW38a7TFxLVe/giphy.gif). We hit a huge milestone with time to spare and plenty of good vibes.

- People are going to be actually **playing the dang game!**. We should be on hand to fight any fires that might arise.

- I think we can actually kind of **chill** this week. See my thoughts below...

## Miscellany

- In a [previous post](/buckle-yer-seatbelts), I described how I've been thinking about the cycles of the development process. However, I'm now realizing that there's a 4th phase in each cycle: **exhale**. Especially as we're waiting for results from playtesting, it feels like a good opportunity to both rest (if people need it), and get ready for the next turn of the wheel.

  My ideal would be to take the next week or so to do two things. The first is just playing around with stuff that's intrinsically interesting to us. I have a huge backlog of tutorials, articles, videos, and libraries that I haven't had a chance to dig into. Having time to play around, learn, build prototypes, and ingest other art is super valuable and restorative.

  The second is to start orienting ourselves towards our next phase of exploration. To do that, I want us to start building up a list of **questions we want to try to answer** during that upcoming phase. Those questions, combined with whatever insights we glean from testing, will form the inputs to that slightly more focussed exploration phase.

- Che has already spearheaded a handful of really valuable discussions around marketing, the name of the team, and the name of the game. I have my own backlog of "high-level concerns", which includes those things, as well as boring things like corporate structure, contracts, standing meetings, re-assessing task management, and formally involving on a marketing person. I was waiting until we actually shipped this playtest before getting into any of it, but now it feels like we're ready to broach those topics. I will most likely be scheduling a meeting soon for us to talk about that stuff.

## And last...
