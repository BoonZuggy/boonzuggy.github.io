title: Competitive Strategies for Broke Nobodies

*Editorial note: I'm gonna take whack at writing down some of the overly-intellectual mental riffs that I've been noodling on in my brain. It feels appropriate to state up front that this (and any subsequent rambles) aren't the result of hard-won wisdom or anything; I'm about as amateur a game creator as you can be. Instead, I want to write this stuff down so I can re-read it once I'm a salty old veteran and laugh at my wide-eyed naivete.*
