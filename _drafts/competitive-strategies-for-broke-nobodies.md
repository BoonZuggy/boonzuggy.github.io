title: Competitive Strategies for Broke Nobodies
---

*Editorial note: I'm gonna take whack at writing down some of the overly-intellectual mental riffs that I've been noodling on in my brain. It feels appropriate to state up front that this (and any subsequent rambles) aren't the result of hard-won wisdom or anything; I'm about as amateur a game creator as one can be. Instead, I want to write this stuff down so I can re-read it once I'm a salty old veteran and laugh at my wide-eyed naivete.*

## A World of Chaos

As an outsider to the field, the games industry feels like a chaotic, roiling ocean; an ocean that happens to be in the midst of a perpetual category-five hurricane. And that hurricane has awoken an irate adolescent kraken, which is now throwing a temper tantrum and capsizing all vessels.

Coming from the world of consumer tech, I previously assumed that that market (specifically, the mobile app market) was one of fastest-moving and most competitive business spaces. I now believe that the modern video game market blows it out of the water. Just about every aspect is more volatile: the products themselves are wildly more complex to create, the publisher-studio relationship seems on the whole to be even more ruthless, fraught, and imbalanced than the VC-startup relationship, massive incumbents launch products that fail spectacularly, and random creators can ship projects from their bedrooms that spawn billion dollar franchises. The distribution channels, customer profiles, technologies, consumption behaviors, aesthetic preferences, and dominant industry players seem to be shifting wildly, and constantly.

Hence the ocean-hurricane-kraken analogy above.

So here we are - four merry lads from the internet who wish to create a game / studio / career on this tumultuous sea. How can we possibly hope to succeed amidst such turbulence, as such a minor and insignificant entity? How can we avoid becoming the kraken's lunch?

There's a bit of tech orthodoxy that I've been indoctrinated with from my other life in consumer tech, where startups are praised (and sometimes do actually succeed, though)
